Big Framework for Yii 2
===================================

Big is a framework offering basic functionality used in many web applications. Big is created to provide a split application with frontend and backend ready for shared hosts.

Additionally Big adds functionality to Yii 2 themes. Within a theme (or a layout file) you can add block positions that will be dynamically loaded into the position.

Why is Big so small?
--------------------

Big consists of one module, 5 widgets and 3 managers.

Widgets:
  - Editor based on TinyMCE 4
  - File manager based on elFinder 2.1 (integrated with the editor widget)
